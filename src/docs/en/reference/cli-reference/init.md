## Overview

## Usage

Run `arc init` in an empty directory will create a default `.arc` manifest file named after that directory with one default function `src/http/get-index`. 

Edit the `.arc` file to add functions and re-run `arc init` to generate local code. This command is intended to be run and re-run; it will only generate files if they do not already exist.
