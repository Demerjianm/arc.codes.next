## Environments

You can use environment variables to store secrets securely and adjust your function's behavior without updating code. An environment variable is a pair of strings that are stored in a function's version-specific configuration. The Lambda runtime makes environment variables available to your code and sets additional environment variables that contain information about the function and invocation request.
