## Speed

Speed is of the utmost importance when building a web app. Less code is faster to write and deploy and Architect makes this possible in a myriad of ways beginning with Infra-as-Code. Determinism that comes as a result of infra as code deployments will speed up the development of your app as well as lower the amount of bugs and side effects.

## Security

With a separation of functions on the cloud, better isolation also equals better security posture and least privilege by default. This lowers your attack vector from nefarious characters.

## Developer experience

Architect aims to provide the fastest developer experience for serverless infrastructure. Extend your app with the entire AWS ecosystem of services and tools with just an `app.arc` file!

Another upside is predictable costs and 100% utilization (scale to zero).
Do less of everything because it's now patching instead of upgrading. You get faster debugging because errors become very shallow in isolation, especially with testing.
